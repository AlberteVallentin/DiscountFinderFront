        This API is developed to provide users with easy access to Salling
        Group's discounted products across their stores (Netto, FÃ¸tex, and
        Bilka). The API fetches data from Salling Group's existing API and
        allows users to view discounted products. The purpose is to reduce food
        waste by making discounted products visible and making it easy for
        consumers to find relevant offers in their local area. The system is
        continuously updated with the latest offers and prices from Salling
        Group stores.
